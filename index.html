	<h4><strong>CoBRE</strong> - Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence</h4>

	<p>Funded by NCRR/NIH programs support thematic multidisciplinary centers that augment and strengthen institutional biomedical research capacity by expanding and developing biomedical faculty research capability.</p>

	<p>CoBREs are expected to grow through the promotion of collaborative interactive efforts amoung researchers with complementary backgrounds, skills, and expertise; and to compete independently for external peer-reviewed center or program project grant support.</p>

	<h4><strong>INBRE</strong> - IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence</h4>

	<p>Funded by NCRR/NIH promotes the development, coordination, and sharing of research and expertise that will expand the research opportunities and increase the number of competitive investigators in the IDeA-eligible states.</p>

	<p>Supported by the NCRR Division of Research Infrastructure (DRI), INBRE are intended to enhance the caliber of scientific faculty at research institutions and undergraduate schools, thereby attracting more promising students to these organizations. INBRE is the second phase of the Biomedical Research Infrastructure Networks (BRIN) Program (which began by providing planning grants in 2001).</p>
