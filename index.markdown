#### **About IDeA**

NCRR's Institutional Development Award (IDeA) program broadens the geographic distribution of NIH funding for biomedical and behavioral research. You can learn more [here](http://www.ncrr.nih.gov/research_infrastructure/institutional_development_award/).

*A Success Story of Louisiana, Scientists from several Louisiana academic institutions attracted over 120 million dollars in competitive NIH funding.*

#### **CoBRE - Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence**

Funded by NCRR/NIH programs support thematic multidisciplinary centers that augment and strengthen institutional biomedical research capacity by expanding and developing biomedical faculty research capability.

CoBREs are expected to grow through the promotion of collaborative interactive efforts amoung researchers with complementary backgrounds, skills, and expertise; and to compete independently for external peer-reviewed center or program project grant support.

#### **INBRE - IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence**

Funded by NCRR/NIH promotes the development, coordination, and sharing of research and expertise that will expand the research opportunities and increase the number of competitive investigators in the IDeA-eligible states.

Supported by the NCRR Division of Research Infrastructure (DRI), INBRE are intended to enhance the caliber of scientific faculty at research institutions and undergraduate schools, thereby attracting more promising students to these organizations. INBRE is the second phase of the Biomedical Research Infrastructure Networks (BRIN) Program (which began by providing planning grants in 2001).

	<h4>Success Story of Louisiana COBRE/INBRE/RCMI</h4>
	<p>
		Scientists from several Louisiana academic institutions attracted over 250 million dollars in competitive National Institutes of Health funding.
	</p>
	<p>
		The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Institutional Development Award Program (IDeA) was established in 1993 to broaden the geographic distribution of NIH funding for biomedical and behavioral research. The program fosters health-related research and enhances the competitiveness of investigators at institutions in 23 states and Puerto Rico. The program also serves unique populations, such as rural and medically underserved communities, in these states. The IDeA program is supported by the National Center for Research Resources (NCRR) Division of Research Infrastructure.
	</p>
	<p>
		The IDeA program has two components, Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) and IDeA Networks of Biomedical Research Excellence (INBRE).
	</p>
	<p>
		COBRE programs build multi-disciplinary research centers with a thematic scientific focus. Junior investigators graduate from the program after they obtain NIH competitive funding on their own.
	</p>
	<p>
		INBRE programs enhance biomedical research capacity in primarily undergraduate institutions in alliance with LSU, as a major research institution in Louisiana.
	</p>
	<p>
		RCMI programs enhance the research capacity and infrastructure at minority colleges and universities that offer doctorates in health sciences. The program serves the dual purpose of bringing more minority scientists into mainstream research and enhancing studies of minority health. The RCMI is also supported by NIH NCRR.
